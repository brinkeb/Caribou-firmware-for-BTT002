# Zaribo-firmware-for-BTT002
This is Marlin 2.0 firmware for Zaribo MK3(s) printers with BTT002 board. The firmware is based on the firmware by "@thisiskeithb" (thank you, great work!!). Take a look at he wire guide, too. Just rename the downloaded file to „firmware.bin“ and copy the file to SD card. Put SD into printer and boot. That´s it! I am not responsible for any issues, use at your own risk.
